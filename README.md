## Reverse engineered schematic parts for the Robomow RM-510 lawn mower 

I am repairing a Robomow RM-510 lawn mower which mowing motor does not works. Test fails with error 55.

The same board is present in the RM-200 (at least it is possible to set it in the service menu)

The main focus of my work is the mowing motor driving circuit:
